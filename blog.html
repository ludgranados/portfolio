<p>Happiness can be increased by placing ones focus on things that one can be grateful for. By focusing on the good things that exist in your life a conscious focus is taking place that may provide you with emotional as well as interpersonal benefits. When gratitude is cultivated the appreciation of the things that are going good in your life can help to create a sense of abundance, of joy of having good things occur in your life. Being happier makes a contribution to a person’s wellbeing which can be the outcome of cultivating the general attitude. Cultivating a general attitude of gratitude can help to reach a state of mind that allows one to appreciate not only major events, but also the simple things in life. Never under estimate the little because a little can go a long way. Just as a cup of coffee may seem a simple pleasure that may brighten up your day, so can the small things that have been good in your day. At one point of life people often begin to hear about counting their blessings. It may be beneficial to an individual to once in a while sit down and do so. In the current fast paced world we live in, the emotion is not only at times neglected but also underestimated as a virtue. Cicero (a Roman philosopher) once declared that “gratitude is not only the greatest of the virtues but the parent of all others”. Gratitude shows us high moral standards that allow an individual to choose to celebrate life. To give to ones self a lesser sense of disappointment, anger, hate, sadness, or fear. Rather then an exchange to offset a burden, gratitude is a gift. It is a gift that one is able to give to his or herself.</p>

     <p>There are no small decisions that may not contain a step towards a change. When we make a choice we signal our brain that we are ready to begin what ever journey the day may present us with. Believing that their are no options may lead to giving up or shutting down, while believing in the existence of options may create an opportunity that may not have existed before. The matrix had a choice of taking the red pill or the blue pill. Even the choice of making a choice is the decision being made by the individual. Every decision has a consequence which can be both good or bad. Habits can be altered by an individual by his or her choices being made throughout the day. A threatened brain is different from a safe feeling brain. Threatened by anxiety of new experiences, or by previous experiences feeling without any other option other then failure, or the safety of familiarity or of knowing the existence of options to make things ok. Every person has faced the world differently and decisions being made have had an impact in their lives one way or another. Something as small as skipping lunch or choosing the wrong meal can have an impact on that person. Eating healthy can lead to one thing and eating fast food can lead to a different road. Just like putting on a shoe leads to putting on the other, choices are made all day and the simplest choice may change or alter a behavior. Habits become old but begin somewhere somehow.</p>
